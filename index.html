		Pinkamena Diane Pie, also known as Pinkie Pie, is the main antagonist of the infamous My Little Pony "grimdark" story "Cupcakes". She is a violent and psychotic murderer who kidnaps her victims and mercilessly rips their organs apart so she can make their organs into cupcakes and dolls.
		</p>
		<p>
		Pinkamena is incredibly callous, sadistic, cruel, deceptive, and homicidal, she's intelligent enough and to know various torture methods and putting on a convincing facade each day, while keeping her twisted secrets hidden within the confines of her workplace. 
		</p>
		<p>
		Another huge aspect or Pinkamena's personality is her increased sadism, she takes glee and is incredibly satisfied and happy when mentally breaking and torturing her victims, she relishes in their screams of pain and begs to get out alive. Obviously, she won't let them leave, as she knows her secret would be discovered.
		You'd think that because she's an anthropomorphic animal she'd be weaker than killers such as Jeff, right? Wrong. Considering she is from the land of Equestria and that the world utilizes magic, it is entirely possible that Pinkamena can get her hands on some kind of magical source in order to defeat her foes, as well as the infamous party cannon. However, if Pinkamena were not to use these sources, she could be caught and either arrested or killed. But it still depends on what her true origins are. Leaving her with an 8.4 rating on the danger level.
